                    <p>An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most orbit other stars, but free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, orbit the galactic center and are untethered to any star</p>

                    <p>Exoplanets are discovered using various methods, including the transit method, radial velocity method, and direct imaging. Each method provides unique data that contribute to our understanding of these distant worlds. <br> The first exoplanets were discovered in the early 1990s, but the first exoplanet to burst upon the world stage was 51 Pegasi b, a “hot Jupiter” orbiting a Sun-like star 50 light-years away. The watershed year was 1995. Since then we’ve discovered thousands more.</p>

                    <h2 class="title1">Why Study Exoplanets?</h2>
                    <p>Studying the diverse range of exoplanets and planetary systems that have been discovered to date – from the small to the large, from those that appear Earth-like to the profoundly bizarre – not only helps us learn about how these particular systems formed and evolved, but provides essential clues towards understanding whether and where life might exist elsewhere in the Universe. These out-of-these-world systems additionally give essential clues to our understanding of how our own Solar System formed and how Earth was created.</p>
